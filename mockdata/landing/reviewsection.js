    review: "This is the only shampoo that helps me with my otherwise greasy hair. I have been trying for a few weeks and it seems that I will continue for a long time. Win win that it is done in Sweden too!"

    review: `The hair becomes clean and soft, I think it works like "regular" shampoo but minus all the strange substances then. A big plus is that the hair is not greasy after just a few days :)`

    review: `My hair started to feel thinner and became extremely dry and brittle due to my thyroid. Almost overnight, my hair went from long, thick, strong and beautiful to thin (extremely thin), frizzy, dry and brittle. I ordered this shampoo and conditioner in sheer desperation after an ad on facebook. After one wash, a single wash, my hair felt 1000 times better and has only gotten better with each wash. I have not seen a reduction in the amount of hair loss (have only used it for a couple of weeks) but even if it only makes my hair healthier, it is worth every penny.`

    review: `I love this company and their shampoo and conditioner. Getting rid of toxic and chemical substances has somehow been a challenge for me with certain things. For example, making my own shampoo turned out to be a catastrophic oily mess (yes I tried!). When I found Under Your Skins, I was overjoyed. Ethical, chemical-free, environmentally friendly, smells fantastic, does a great job! It does not foam in the same way as the store-bought products do, but since that effect is produced by chemicals, it is something I am more than happy to be without :)`

    review: `Due to the high cost of this shampoo, I waited several weeks before buying it. But after trying it for a week I was instead really pleasantly surprised! It only takes a small amount to lather up (less lather than other shampoos) and make my hair shiny, clean and fuller. Thanks! It is noticeable that it is made by a company that is really passionate about what they create. After using for two weeks, I can truly say that it exceeds my expectations.`

    review: `I bought this to deal with an itchy scalp after an ad on instagram. I think it has worked but it has only been a week, but what has really made me happy is that my hair actually feels soft and not at all heavy or greasy. I usually avoid moisturizing shampoos because my hair looks dull, but that has made it almost fluffy. My natural waves look better than before, and the scent is relaxing. Totally worth the price!`

    review: `I do not sprinkle with my compliments but this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used! The hair feels so clean, so fresh, both are thick and the conditioner straightens and smoothes. I can not stop feeling my hair. I have never experienced this before in my life and then I have tried lots of products. Maria Nila, Kevin Murphy, throw yourself into the wall! 💚`

    review: `I was happy when I found a vegan alternative in a Swedish and organic shampoo. Had previously had maria Nila but unfortunately got a rash on the scalp. Repaired quickly with this amazing set. Is also great for the kids who have used it and also their thick hair that needs care. A big plus for the flexible pump that sits on the bottle`

    review: `Gives a fresh scent, the hair is easy to sort out and manages to keep the hair fresh in the washing interval I usually run with. (Every other day) it will be exciting to see if the hair after the detox can handle a long interval between washes. Have only used the product for just over 1 week. The kids like it too.`
