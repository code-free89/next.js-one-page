    <p>Under Your Skin was born from the belief that what we put on our skin eventually ends up under the skin. What we apply to it is therefore as important as what we put in us - you are what you lubricate.</p><br/>
    <p>While strong chemicals have long been banned in the food industry due to negative environmental effects, the same chemicals are still allowed in skin care. </p><br/>
    <p>Under Your Skin is here to help eliminate questionable chemicals.</p><br/>
    <p>As a first step to prove that this is possible, they have created a series of high quality products without unnecessary chemicals.</p><br/>
    <p>Under Your Skin is owned and run by mother-daughter duo Christina & Lovisa Hahn.</p>`,
